# **Insertion at a Certain Position: Singly Linked List vs. Arrays**

## **Introduction**
In this session, we analyze the time complexity of inserting an element at an absolute position in both **Singly Linked Lists** and **Arrays**. Understanding these complexities is crucial for optimizing data structures in various applications.

## **Insertion in a Singly Linked List**
### **Steps for Insertion**
1. **Traverse the list** until reaching the desired position (O(N) in the worst case).
2. **Create a new node** with the given value.
3. **Adjust pointers**:
   - Set the new node’s `next` to the current node’s `next`.
   - Update the previous node’s `next` to point to the new node.
4. **Insertion Complete**.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Best Case**: O(1) (if inserting at the head)
- **Worst Case**: O(N) (if inserting at the tail or any middle position)

## **Insertion in an Array**
### **Steps for Insertion**
1. **Shift elements** to the right to create space for the new element.
2. **Insert the new element** at the desired position.
3. **Insertion Complete**.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Best Case**: O(1) (if inserting at the end)
- **Worst Case**: O(N) (if inserting at the beginning or middle, requiring shifts)

## **Comparison: Singly Linked List vs. Array**
| Operation       | Singly Linked List | Array |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Insertion at Head | O(1) | O(N) |
| Insertion at Middle | O(N) | O(N) |
| Insertion at Tail | O(N) | O(1) |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Singly Linked Lists** are **better** when frequent insertions at arbitrary positions are needed.
- **Arrays** provide **constant-time** insertions at the end but suffer when inserting in the middle.
- **Choice of Data Structure** depends on the use case and performance requirements.
