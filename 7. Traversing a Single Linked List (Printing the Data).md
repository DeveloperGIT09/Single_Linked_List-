# Traversing a Single Linked List (Printing the Data)

## Introduction
Traversing a singly linked list is essential for accessing its data. In this guide, we will understand how to print the data stored in each node of a singly linked list using a simple C program.

---

## Program Overview
- **Header Files Used**: `#include <stdio.h>` and `#include <stdlib.h>`.
- **Structure of Node**:
  - `struct node` contains two parts:
    - `data` (stores the value)
    - `link` (pointer to the next node)
- **Function Used**: `print_data(head)`, where `head` is the pointer to the first node.

---

## Assumption
We assume that the linked list is already created and `head` points to the first node. Our task is to traverse the list and print each nodeâ€™s data.

---

## Printing Function Breakdown
### 1. Checking for Empty List
```c
if (head == NULL) {
    printf("Linked list is empty\n");
    return;
}
```
- If `head` is `NULL`, it means the list is empty, and we print an appropriate message.

### 2. Initializing Pointer
```c
struct node *ptr = NULL;
ptr = head;
```
- `ptr` is a temporary pointer initialized to `NULL`.
- It is then assigned the address of `head`, so it points to the first node.

### 3. Traversing the List
```c
while (ptr != NULL) {
    printf("%d ", ptr->data); // Printing data
    ptr = ptr->link; // Moving to the next node
}
```
- The loop runs until `ptr` becomes `NULL`.
- Prints `ptr->data` (data of the current node).
- Updates `ptr` to point to the next node (`ptr = ptr->link`).

---

## Step-by-Step Execution
### Example Linked List:
Assume the linked list has the following nodes:
```
[ 45 | 1000 ] --> [ 98 | 2000 ] --> [ 3 | NULL ]
```

### Execution Steps:
1. **`ptr` starts at head (1000)**
   - `ptr != NULL` â†’ Print `45`
   - Move to `ptr->link` (2000)

2. **`ptr` now at 2000**
   - `ptr != NULL` â†’ Print `98`
   - Move to `ptr->link` (3000)

3. **`ptr` now at 3000**
   - `ptr != NULL` â†’ Print `3`
   - Move to `ptr->link` (NULL)

4. **`ptr` becomes NULL**
   - Exit loop.

**Final Output:**
```
45 98 3
```

---

## Summary
- The function `print_data()` traverses the linked list and prints each nodeâ€™s data.
- Uses a while loop until `ptr` reaches `NULL`.
- Ensures an empty list is handled properly.

This is a simple and efficient way to print a singly linked list!
