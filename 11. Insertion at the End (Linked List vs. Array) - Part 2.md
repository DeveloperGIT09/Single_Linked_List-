# **Insertion at the End (Linked List vs. Array)**

## **Introduction**
Insertion at the end is a fundamental operation in both **Arrays** and **Linked Lists**. However, the time complexity and method of insertion vary significantly between the two data structures. This document explores the process of inserting an element at the end in both cases and compares their efficiency.

## **Insertion in an Array**
### **Case 1: When the Array is Not Full**
1. **Find the last index**: The last element's index can be determined using a counter or by maintaining the array size.
2. **Insert the element**: Place the new element at the next available index.
3. **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (Direct assignment to the last position).

### **Case 2: When the Array is Full**
1. **Create a New Array**: Allocate a new array with increased size (typically double the original size).
2. **Copy Elements**: Transfer all elements from the old array to the new one.
3. **Insert New Element**: Place the new element at the end of the newly created array.
4. **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (Copying elements from the old array to the new array).

## **Insertion in a Linked List**
### **Steps for Insertion at the End in a Singly Linked List**
1. **Traverse to the Last Node**: Start from the head and traverse the list until the last node is reached.
2. **Create a New Node**: Allocate memory for the new node and assign the value.
3. **Link the Last Node to the New Node**: Set the `next` pointer of the last node to the new node.
4. **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (Traversing to the last node).

### **Steps for Insertion at the End in a Doubly Linked List**
1. **Traverse to the Last Node**: Start from the head and move to the last node.
2. **Create a New Node**: Allocate memory for the new node and assign the value.
3. **Update Pointers**: Set the `next` of the last node to the new node and update the `prev` pointer of the new node.
4. **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (Traversing to the last node).

### **Optimized Approach Using Tail Pointer**
1. If the linked list maintains a tail pointer (pointer to the last node), insertion can be done in **O(1)** time by directly updating the tail's `next` pointer.

## **Comparison: Array vs. Linked List**
| Feature           | Array (Dynamic)         | Singly Linked List       | Doubly Linked List       |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Insertion (Not Full)**  | O(1)                  | O(n) (traversal required) | O(n) (traversal required) |
| **Insertion (Full)**      | O(n) (copy elements) | O(n)                     | O(n)                     |
| **Space Efficiency**      | Fixed size or requires resizing | Dynamic, no resizing needed | More space due to extra pointers |
| **Direct Access**        | Yes (Indexing)       | No (Sequential Access)   | No (Sequential Access)   |
| **Tail Pointer Optimization** | N/A | O(1) with tail pointer | O(1) with tail pointer |

## **Conclusion**
- **Arrays** provide **fast O(1) insertion** if space is available but require **O(n) time** when resizing.
- **Linked Lists** allow dynamic memory allocation but need **O(n) traversal** to reach the end for insertion.
- Maintaining a **tail pointer** in a linked list significantly reduces the insertion time to **O(1)**.
- Choosing between an **array** and a **linked list** depends on the **use case**:
  - If frequent end insertions are required, **a linked list with a tail pointer is preferable**.
  - If random access is necessary, **an array is more efficient**.

âœ… **Key Takeaway**: Use **arrays** for efficient indexing and **linked lists** for dynamic size flexibility.
