# 📌 **Singly Linked List - Solved Problem 1**  

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**  
Given an **unsorted singly linked list** represented with a **head** (first node) and a **tail** (last node) pointer, determine **which operation cannot be performed in O(1) time**.  

📌 **Operations to analyze:**  
- (A) Insertion at the front  
- (B) Insertion at the end  
- (C) Deletion of the front node  
- (D) Deletion of the last node  

### 🏆 **Asked in UGC NET CS 2016**

## 📝 **Solution Explanation**  

### ✅ **(A) Insertion at the Front** - O(1)  
1. Create a new node.  
2. Update the new node’s `next` pointer to the current `head`.  
3. Move the `head` pointer to the new node.  

**🔹 Takes constant time (O(1)) since no traversal is required.**  

---

### ✅ **(B) Insertion at the End** - O(1)  
1. Create a new node.  
2. Update the `next` pointer of the current `tail` node to the new node.  
3. Move the `tail` pointer to the new node.  

**🔹 Takes constant time (O(1)) because we already have a direct reference to the tail node.**  

---

### ✅ **(C) Deletion of the Front Node** - O(1)  
1. Use a temporary pointer to store the `head` node.  
2. Move the `head` pointer to the next node.  
3. Delete the old head node.  

**🔹 Takes constant time (O(1)) since no traversal is needed.**  

---

### ❌ **(D) Deletion of the Last Node** - O(n)  
1. **Problem:** We only have a `tail` pointer, but we need the **second last node** to update its `next` pointer to `NULL`.  
2. **Solution:**  
   - Start from the `head` and traverse the list to find the **second last node**.  
   - Update its `next` pointer to `NULL`.  
   - Move the `tail` pointer to this second last node.  
   - Delete the last node.  

⏳ **Time Complexity: O(n) (because we must traverse the list).**  

---

## 🎯 **Final Answer**  
👉 **(D) Deletion of the last node is NOT O(1); it takes O(n).**  

✅ **Correct Answer: Option (D)**  

---

### 💡 **Key Takeaways**  
🔹 Insertion at the **front** and **end** is O(1) due to direct pointers.  
🔹 Deletion at the **front** is O(1), but **deletion at the end** requires O(n) traversal.  
🔹 Always consider **how many pointers are available** when analyzing time complexity in linked lists.
