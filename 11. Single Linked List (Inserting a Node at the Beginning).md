# **Inserting a Node at the Beginning (Singly Linked List)**

## **Introduction**
Inserting a node at the beginning of a **Singly Linked List (SLL)** is a fundamental operation that allows quick modifications to the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists enable **O(1) insertion time** at the beginning without shifting elements. This guide covers the process, implementation, and time complexity analysis.

## **Steps for Insertion at the Beginning**
### **1. Create a New Node**
- Allocate memory for a new node.
- Assign a value to the new node.

### **2. Update the New Nodeâ€™s Next Pointer**
- Set the `next` pointer of the new node to point to the current head of the linked list.

### **3. Update the Head Pointer**
- Set the `head` pointer to the newly created node, making it the first node in the list.

## **Algorithm**
```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

void insertAtBeginning(Node*& head, int newData) {
    // Step 1: Create a new node
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = newData;
    
    // Step 2: Point new node to current head
    newNode->next = head;
    
    // Step 3: Update head to the new node
    head = newNode;
}
```

## **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Best Case**: **O(1)** (Only pointer manipulations are required)
- **Worst Case**: **O(1)** (Same as best case since there is no traversal)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (No extra space required except the new node)

---

## **Example Execution**
### **Initial Linked List:**
```
Head -> [10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
```
### **After inserting 5 at the beginning:**
```
Head -> [5] -> [10] -> [20] -> [30] -> NULL
```

## **Advantages of Insertion at the Beginning**
âœ” **Fast operation** â€“ Always takes **O(1) time**.
âœ” **Efficient for dynamic lists** â€“ No shifting like arrays.
âœ” **Useful in Stack implementation** â€“ Can be used for push operations.

---

## **Conclusion**
- Inserting at the beginning of a **Singly Linked List** is an **efficient** operation with **O(1) complexity**.
- It is achieved by **modifying only the head pointer** and the `next` pointer of the new node.
- Ideal for applications that require **frequent insertions at the front**, such as **stack operations and dynamic list updates**.

ðŸš€ **Key Takeaway**: If **frequent front insertions** are needed, a **linked list is more efficient than an array**!
