# **Singly Linked List: Deleting a Node at a Particular Position**

## **Introduction**
- In a **Singly Linked List (SLL)**, deleting a node at a specific position requires updating the pointers of the previous node.
- We will go through the **algorithm and code implementation** to understand how to remove a node efficiently.

---

## **Algorithm to Delete a Node at a Given Position**
1. **Check if the list is empty**  
   - If `head == NULL`, return as there is nothing to delete.

2. **Check if the first node needs to be deleted**  
   - If the position is **1**, update `head = head->next` and free the old head.

3. **Traverse to the node just before the target node**  
   - Use a loop to reach `(position - 1)th` node.

4. **Update the next pointer of the previous node**  
   - Set `prev->next = temp->next`, effectively removing the target node.

5. **Free the memory of the deleted node**  
   - Use `free(temp)` to deallocate memory.

## **Code Implementation in C++**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = NULL;
    }
};

void deleteNode(Node*& head, int position) {
    if (head == NULL) return; // Empty list case

    Node* temp = head;

    // If deleting the first node
    if (position == 1) {
        head = temp->next;
        delete temp;
        return;
    }

    // Traverse to the node before the target
    Node* prev = NULL;
    for (int i = 1; temp != NULL && i < position; i++) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // If position is out of bounds
    if (temp == NULL) return;

    // Update link and delete node
    prev->next = temp->next;
    delete temp;
}

// Function to print linked list
void printList(Node* head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        cout << head->data << " -> ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << "NULL\n";
}

// Driver function
int main() {
    Node* head = new Node(10);
    head->next = new Node(20);
    head->next->next = new Node(30);
    head->next->next->next = new Node(40);

    cout << "Original List:\n";
    printList(head);

    deleteNode(head, 3);

    cout << "After Deletion at Position 3:\n";
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

## **Time Complexity Analysis**
| Case       | Complexity |
|------------|------------|
| **Deleting Head Node** | O(1) |
| **Deleting Any Other Node** | O(N) (Worst case: deleting the last node) |

---

## **Key Takeaways**
âœ… Always **handle edge cases** (empty list, single-node list, invalid position).  
âœ… Use **a pointer to track the previous node** before deletion.  
âœ… **Memory deallocation** is crucial to prevent memory leaks.  
âœ… Deleting the first node requires **updating the head pointer** separately.

This is a **clear and structured guide** to help you understand and implement **node deletion at a given position** in a **singly linked list**. ðŸš€
