# 📌 **Deletion at the End: Singly Linked List vs. Array**  

## 🔹 **1. Introduction**  
In this presentation, we compare the **time complexity** of deleting the last node from a **Singly Linked List** and deleting the last element from an **Array**.  

---

## 🔹 **2. Deleting Last Element in an Array**  
### ✅ **Steps**  
1. Simply decrease the array size by **one**.  
2. No need to shift elements.  

### ⏳ **Time Complexity**  
- **O(1) (Constant Time)** → As there is no traversal required.  

---

## 🔹 **3. Deleting Last Node in a Singly Linked List**  
### ✅ **Steps**  
1. **Traverse** the linked list to find the second last node.  
2. Update the second last node’s `next` pointer to `NULL`.  
3. Free the memory of the last node.  

### ⏳ **Time Complexity**  
- **O(n) (Linear Time)** → Because we must traverse the list to reach the second last node.

## 🔹 **4. Comparison Table**  

| **Data Structure** | **Steps Involved** | **Time Complexity** |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Array** | Reduce size by 1 | **O(1)** |
| **Singly Linked List** | Traverse to second last node and update `next` | **O(n)** |

---

## 🔹 **5. Key Takeaways**  
✅ **Arrays** are more efficient for deleting the last element as it takes **constant time O(1)**.  
✅ **Singly Linked Lists** require **traversal**, making deletion **O(n)** in the worst case.  
✅ If frequent deletions at the end are required, **Doubly Linked List** or other dynamic data structures may be better alternatives.  

---

🛑 **Conclusion:** Deleting the last element in an **array** is faster compared to a **singly linked list** because arrays allow **direct access** while linked lists require **traversal**.
