# Traversing a Single Linked List (Counting the Nodes)

## **Introduction**
Traversing a **Single Linked List** means visiting each node sequentially from the first node (head) to the last node. One common application of traversal is **counting the number of nodes** in the list.

## **Concept of Traversing a Single Linked List**
- **Definition**: Visiting each node of a single linked list until the end node is reached.
- **Example**: Given a linked list, we traverse it while keeping count of the number of nodes.
- **Objective**: Traverse the list and count the number of nodes.

## **Understanding the Head Pointer**
- The `head` pointer stores the address of the first node.
- Using `head`, we can access all nodes in the list.
- We assume that the linked list is **already created**.

## **Code Implementation**
The following program counts the number of nodes in a singly linked list.

### **Header Files**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

### **Structure Definition**
```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* link;
};
```

### **Counting Function**
```c
int count_of_nodes(struct node* head) {
    int count = 0;
    struct node* ptr = head;
    
    while (ptr != NULL) {
        count++;
        ptr = ptr->link;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### **Main Function**
```c
int main() {
    struct node* head = NULL; // Assume list is created
    printf("Total nodes: %d", count_of_nodes(head));
    return 0;
}
```

## **Step-by-Step Execution**
### **Step 1: Initialize Count Variable**
```c
int count = 0;
```
- This keeps track of the number of nodes.
- Initially set to zero.

### **Step 2: Handle Empty List**
```c
if (head == NULL) {
    printf("Linked List is empty");
    return 0;
}
```
- If `head == NULL`, it means the linked list is empty.
- We print a message and exit the function.

### **Step 3: Initialize Pointer for Traversal**
```c
struct node* ptr = head;
```
- Pointer `ptr` starts from `head`.
- `ptr` will traverse the linked list.

### **Step 4: Traverse and Count Nodes**
```c
while (ptr != NULL) {
    count++;
    ptr = ptr->link;
}
```
- Traverse the list using `ptr`.
- Increment `count` at each node.
- Move `ptr` to the next node (`ptr = ptr->link`).
- Stop when `ptr == NULL`.

### **Step 5: Print Count**
```c
printf("Total nodes: %d", count);
```
- Display the total number of nodes in the linked list.

## **Example Execution**
Consider the following linked list:
```
[10 | 1000] -> [20 | 2000] -> [30 | NULL]
```
### **Tracking Values**
| Iteration | `ptr` (Address) | `ptr->link` (Next Address) | Count |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|-------|
| 1st       | 1000           | 2000                      | 1     |
| 2nd       | 2000           | 3000                      | 2     |
| 3rd       | 3000           | NULL                      | 3     |
| 4th       | NULL           | -                         | Exit  |

### **Final Output**
```
Total nodes: 3
```

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Traversing** a linked list means visiting each node until reaching `NULL`.
2. **Head Pointer** is essential to access the linked list.
3. **Counting Nodes** requires a loop that increments a counter for each node.
4. **If the list is empty (`head == NULL`)**, display a message and return `0`.
5. **Efficiency**: The approach has a time complexity of **O(n)** (linear time complexity).
