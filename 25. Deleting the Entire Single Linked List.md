Here are attractive and well-structured notes on **Deleting the Entire Single Linked List**:

# **Deleting the Entire Single Linked List**
A **Single Linked List** consists of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Deleting the entire linked list involves freeing up memory for each node and ensuring that the head pointer is set to `NULL`.

---

## **Approach to Delete the Entire Linked List**
To delete a **Single Linked List**, follow these steps:
1. **Initialize a pointer** `current` that starts from the head node.
2. **Traverse the list** while `current` is not `NULL`:
   - Store the next node in a temporary pointer (`temp`).
   - Free the memory of the `current` node.
   - Move `current` to the next node (`temp`).
3. **Set head to NULL** after deletion to avoid dangling references.

---

## **Algorithm**
```cpp
void deleteLinkedList(Node** head) {
    Node* current = *head;
    Node* temp;

    while (current != NULL) {
        temp = current->next;  // Store next node
        free(current);         // Free current node
        current = temp;        // Move to next node
    }
    
    *head = NULL;  // Set head to NULL
}
```

---

## **Dry Run Example**
Consider a linked list:
```
Head â†’ [10] â†’ [20] â†’ [30] â†’ [40] â†’ NULL
```

1. `current` points to 10, `temp` stores address of 20, free 10.
2. `current` moves to 20, `temp` stores address of 30, free 20.
3. `current` moves to 30, `temp` stores address of 40, free 30.
4. `current` moves to 40, `temp` stores `NULL`, free 40.
5. Set `head = NULL`.

**Final List:**
```
Head â†’ NULL
```
**(Entire list is deleted)**

## **Time Complexity & Space Complexity**
| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|------------|
| Traversal | **O(N)** |
| Deletion  | **O(N)** |
| Space Complexity | **O(1)** (Only a few extra pointers used) |

---

## **Key Points to Remember**
âœ… Always **free memory** to prevent memory leaks.  
âœ… Update the `head` to **NULL** after deletion.  
âœ… The function modifies the list, so **pass head by reference** (`Node** head`).  
âœ… Works for **any size of linked list** including an **empty list**.  

---

## **Conclusion**
Deleting a **Single Linked List** is a straightforward process of iterating through the list, freeing each node, and updating the head pointer to `NULL`. This ensures that all memory allocated to the list is released.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Always perform a **NULL check** before accessing nodes to avoid segmentation faults!
