# 📌 **Deletion at the Beginning: Singly Linked List vs. Array**  

## 🔹 **1. Introduction**  
In this session, we compare the **time complexity** of deleting the first element from a **Singly Linked List** and an **Array**.  

---

## 🔹 **2. Deleting First Element in an Array**  
### ✅ **Steps**  
1. Remove the first element.  
2. Shift all remaining elements **one position left**.  

### ⏳ **Time Complexity**  
- **O(n) (Linear Time)** → Because all elements need to be shifted.  

---

## 🔹 **3. Deleting First Node in a Singly Linked List**  
### ✅ **Steps**  
1. Update the `head` pointer to point to the **next node**.  
2. Free the memory of the previous first node.  

### ⏳ **Time Complexity**  
- **O(1) (Constant Time)** → No need to shift elements, just update the head pointer.

## 🔹 **4. Comparison Table**  

| **Data Structure** | **Steps Involved** | **Time Complexity** |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Array** | Shift elements left | **O(n)** |
| **Singly Linked List** | Update head pointer | **O(1)** |

---

## 🔹 **5. Key Takeaways**  
✅ **Singly Linked List** is more efficient for deleting the first element as it takes **O(1) time**.  
✅ **Arrays** require **O(n) time** because of element shifting.  
✅ If frequent deletions at the beginning are required, **Linked Lists** are a better choice.  

---

🛑 **Conclusion:** **Singly Linked Lists** are more efficient for deletion at the beginning, whereas **Arrays** require shifting, making them slower.
