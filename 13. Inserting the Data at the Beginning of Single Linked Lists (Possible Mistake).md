# Inserting Data at the Beginning of a Single Linked List (Possible Mistake)

## Introduction
Inserting a node at the beginning of a **Singly Linked List (SLL)** is a fundamental operation. However, there is a common mistake that many beginners make while performing this operation. In this guide, we will discuss the correct approach and the possible mistake that can occur.

## **Steps to Insert Data at the Beginning**
1. **Create a new node**: Allocate memory for a new node and assign the data value.
2. **Point the new node to the current head**: Set the `next` pointer of the new node to the current head of the linked list.
3. **Update the head pointer**: Make the new node the head of the list.

**Code Implementation (C++):**
```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

void insertAtBeginning(Node*& head, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = head;
    head = newNode;
}
```

## **Possible Mistake**
### **Mistake: Passing the Head by Value Instead of Reference**

If we pass the `head` by value, changes inside the function will not reflect in the original list. This happens because a copy of the `head` pointer is modified instead of the actual `head`.

**Incorrect Code:**
```cpp
void insertAtBeginning(Node* head, int value) { // Head passed by value
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = head; // Modifies local copy
    head = newNode; // Changes not reflected outside the function
}
```

### **Why is this a Problem?**
- The `head` pointer in the main function remains unchanged.
- The new node is created but never properly linked to the actual list.
- Memory leak can occur since the new node is not connected to the actual list.

### **Correct Approach: Pass Head by Reference**
To modify the actual head pointer, we should pass it by reference (`&`) or by using a pointer to pointer (`Node**`).

**Correct Code:**
```cpp
void insertAtBeginning(Node*& head, int value) { // Head passed by reference
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = head;
    head = newNode;
}
```

Alternatively, using a double pointer:
```cpp
void insertAtBeginning(Node** head, int value) { // Double pointer approach
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = *head;
    *head = newNode;
}
```

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- Always pass the `head` by **reference** (`&`) or **pointer to pointer** (`Node**`).
- Modifying a local copy of `head` inside a function does not affect the original list.
- Improper handling of `head` leads to **memory leaks** and incorrect list modifications.

By avoiding this common mistake, we can ensure that our **Singly Linked List operations work correctly and efficiently!** ðŸš€
