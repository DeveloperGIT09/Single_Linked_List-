**Insertion at the End: Linked List vs. Array (Part 1)**

### **1. Introduction**
- Comparison between linked lists and arrays in terms of inserting a new element at the end.
- Focus on the time complexity for linked list insertion.

### **2. Insertion in a Linked List**
#### **a. Initial Approach (Traversing the List)**
- Given a linked list, the function `add_at_end` is used to insert a node at the end.
- The traversal loop takes **O(n)** time, where **n** is the number of nodes.
- The remaining operations (node creation and linking) take constant time.
- Asymptotic complexity: **O(n)**.

#### **b. Optimized Approach (Without Traversal)**
- Instead of traversing the list each time, maintain a pointer to the last node.
- Each insertion updates this pointer, avoiding full traversal.
- **Steps for Optimization:**
  1. Initialize a linked list by creating the first node (head points to it).
  2. Maintain a pointer `ptr` to track the last node.
  3. On each `add_at_end` call:
     - Create a new node.
     - Update the `link` of the last node (`ptr->link = temp`).
     - Update `ptr` to point to the new last node.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(1)** for insertion, as traversal is eliminated.

#### **c. Final Observations**
- Always pass `ptr` (last node) instead of `head` to `add_at_end`.
- After forming the list, reset `ptr` to `head` for traversal.
- This optimized method significantly improves efficiency over the initial approach.

### **3. Comparison with Array**
- The discussion on inserting an element at the end of an array is reserved for the next part.

### **4. Conclusion**
- Using a pointer to track the last node eliminates traversal, reducing insertion time complexity from **O(n)** to **O(1)**.
- This optimization is crucial for efficient linked list operations.
