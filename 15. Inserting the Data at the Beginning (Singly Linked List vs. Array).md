# **Inserting Data at the Beginning: Singly Linked List vs. Array**

## **Introduction**
When inserting data at the beginning of a data structure, we must consider:
- **Time Complexity**
- **Memory Usage**
- **Ease of Implementation**

## **1. Insertion in an Array**
An **array** is a contiguous block of memory where elements are stored sequentially. To insert a new element at the beginning:
1. Shift all existing elements one position to the right.
2. Place the new element at index `0`.

### **Time Complexity**
- Shifting elements takes **O(n)** time in the worst case.
- If the array is **dynamically allocated**, resizing may be required, adding more overhead.

### **Space Complexity**
- No extra space is required apart from the existing array allocation.

### **Pros**
‚úÖ Direct access using index.  
‚úÖ Simple structure and easy to use.

### **Cons**
‚ùå **Insertion is slow** because shifting is required.  
‚ùå Fixed size in statically allocated arrays.

## **2. Insertion in a Singly Linked List**
A **singly linked list** consists of **nodes**, where each node contains:
- **Data**
- **A pointer to the next node**

To insert at the beginning:
1. Create a new node.
2. Point the new node's `next` to the current head.
3. Update the head to the new node.

### **Time Complexity**
- Only pointer updates are needed ‚Üí **O(1) (Constant Time)**.

### **Space Complexity**
- Requires additional space for storing pointers.

### **Pros**
‚úÖ **Faster insertion** (O(1)) as no shifting is required.  
‚úÖ **Dynamic size**, can grow or shrink efficiently.  

### **Cons**
‚ùå No direct access to elements (sequential traversal is needed).  
‚ùå Uses extra memory for storing pointers.

## **Comparison Table**
| Feature                | Array (Insertion at Beginning) | Singly Linked List (Insertion at Beginning) |
|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Time Complexity**    | O(n)                         | O(1)                                      |
| **Space Complexity**   | O(1)                         | O(n) (Extra space for pointers)          |
| **Insertion Speed**    | Slow (Shifting required)     | Fast (Pointer update only)                |
| **Direct Access**      | Yes (Indexing available)     | No (Sequential access required)           |
| **Memory Efficiency**  | Efficient                    | Uses extra space for pointers             |
| **Flexibility**        | Fixed size (static arrays)   | Dynamic size (grows/shrinks as needed)    |

## **Conclusion**
- If frequent insertions at the beginning are needed ‚Üí **Singly Linked List is better** (O(1) time).
- If random access and indexing are more important ‚Üí **Arrays are better**.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Arrays** are best for fast access but slow for insertions at the beginning.
- **Linked Lists** are best for fast insertions but require more memory.
